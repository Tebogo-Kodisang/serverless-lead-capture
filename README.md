# Serverless Lead Capture on AWS: The Epic Books

## Project Overview
Epic Books is a mock company created for this project. The business needed a simple way to collect customer names and email addresses from its website.

To solve this, I built a serverless solution on AWS. This removes the need to manage servers, which also reduces infrastructure costs and eliminates the need to hire staff to maintain them. The solution automatically scales as website visitors increase and improves security by using managed AWS services instead of self-hosted systems.

## Business Goals
* **Global Reach**: Ensure the website is highly responsive for users regardless of their location.
* **Security & Privacy**: Protect customer data using industry-standard encryption and secure storage.
* **Scalability**: Build a system that automatically handles spikes in traffic as the business grows.
* **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminate the need for manual server management and reduce staffing overhead.
* **Lead/Customer Capture Form**: Provide a simple, user-friendly interface to collect names and email addresses.
