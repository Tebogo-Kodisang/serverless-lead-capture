# Serverless Lead Capture on AWS: The Epic Books

## Project Overview
Epic Books is a mock company created for this project. The business needed a simple way to collect customer names and email addresses from it's website.

To solve this, I built a serverless solution on AWS. This removes the need to manage servers, which also removes the cost of hiring people to maintain them. It also reduces infrastructure costs, automatically scales as website visitors increase, and improves security by using managed AWS services instead of self-hosted systems.

## Business Goals
* **Global Reach**: Ensure the website is highly responsive for users regardless of their location. 
* **Security & Privay**: Protect customer data using industry-standard encryption and secure storage.
* **Sacalability**: Build a system that automatically handles spikes in traffic as the business grows.
* **Opertaional Efficiency**: Eliminate the need for manual server management and reduce staffing overhead. 
* **Lead/Customer Capture Form**: A simple, user-friendly interface to collect names and email addresses.
